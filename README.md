# üõí Comprehensive Data Analysis of Retail Store Sales
In this portfolio, I analyze retail store sales data using a dataset sourced from Kaggle([Dirty Retail Store Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/retail-store-sales-dirty-for-data-cleaning/data)). The objective is to clean and process the data while exploring key aspects such as transaction patterns, product performance, discount effectiveness, and transaction location preferences. Through data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering, I extract meaningful insights to understand retail store operations better. Finally, I present business recommendations based on the findings, which can support strategic decision-making to enhance sales and operational efficiency.

## üìÇ Data Source
The dataset contains 12,575 rows of synthetic sales transaction data from a retail store. It includes eight product categories with 25 items per category, each with fixed pricing.
  
## üéØ Objectives
This case study explores key metrics such as the free-to-paid conversion rate, the average time from registration to first engagement, and the time from first engagement to purchase. Additionally, retention rate and churn rate will be analyzed to understand the sustainability of student subscriptions. By identifying these activity patterns, 365 Data Science can optimize engagement strategies, enhance user retention, and drive long-term growth.

## üìä Analysis Results
### 1. Conversion Rate: 11.29%
Only 11.29% of students who start watching videos end up making a purchase. This indicates that the majority of students (almost 89%) who use the platform for free are either not interested or not sufficiently encouraged to make a purchase. Possible reasons could be a lack of incentives to subscribe, unclear premium benefits, or an overall user experience that is not engaging enough.

### 2. Average Time from Registration to First Watch: 3.42 days
On average, a student takes 3.42 days from the registration date to start watching their first video. This suggests that most students do not engage immediately after signing up, which could indicate a lack of initial appeal, an ineffective onboarding strategy, or a confusing user interface.

### 3. Average Time from Registration to Purchase: 29.75 days
Students who eventually make a purchase take an average of 29.75 days from registration to subscription. This shows that students need a significant amount of time to experience the platform's value before committing to a purchase.

### 4. Average Time from First Watch to Purchase: 26.25 days
After watching their first video, students still take 26.25 days before making a purchase. This suggests that the first viewing experience is not strong enough to immediately drive conversions.

### 5. Retention Rate: 4.65%
Only 4.65% of students make more than one purchase. This indicates that most students who purchase a subscription only do so once and do not renew. Possible reasons could be a lack of ongoing exclusive content, pricing misalignment with expectations, or insufficient personalization in the learning journey.

### 6. Churn Rate: 88.71%
A very high churn rate (88.71%) indicates that most students who start watching videos do not proceed to purchase. This suggests that while they are initially interested in trying the platform, they are not sufficiently encouraged to commit further.

### 7. Same-Day Conversion Rate: 5.57%
Only 5.57% of students make a purchase on the same day they start watching. This suggests that most students need more time to explore the platform before making a purchasing decision.

## üèÜ Conclusion
The platform faces key challenges, including:
- A low conversion rate and high churn rate, indicating difficulties in converting free users into paying customers.
- A long average time from registration to purchase, suggesting the need for improvements in onboarding and promotional strategies.
- A low retention rate, implying that the platform needs to enhance the appeal of its content and the long-term value for paying subscribers.
