# üõí Comprehensive Data Analysis of Retail Store Sales
In this portfolio, I analyze retail store sales data using a dataset sourced from Kaggle ([Dirty Retail Store Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/retail-store-sales-dirty-for-data-cleaning/data)). The objective is to clean and process the data while exploring key aspects such as transaction patterns, product performance, discount effectiveness, and transaction location preferences. Through data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering, I extract meaningful insights to understand retail store operations better. Finally, I present business recommendations based on the findings, which can support strategic decision-making to enhance sales and operational efficiency.

## üìÇ Data Source
The dataset contains 12,575 rows of synthetic sales transaction data from a retail store. It includes eight product categories with 25 items per category, each with fixed pricing.

## üìä Analysis Results
### 1. Transactions Performance Analysis
Sales peak in December-January due to year-end holidays and major discounts, then decline in February as spending slows. Revenue follows a similar trend, with early-year dips and year-end surges. To maximize sales, the store should focus on year-end promotions, clearance sales in February, and strategic inventory management.

### 2. Product Performance Analysis
Beverages, electric household essentials, furniture, and food drive high sales and revenue, while milk sells frequently but contributes less due to its lower price. Butcher products are rarely purchased but generate high revenue per sale. To optimize sales, the store should ensure stock availability for high-demand items, bundle milk with complementary products, and target butcher products toward premium customers or special occasions.

### 3. Discount Effectiveness Analysis
Discounts drive 66% of transactions, showing their strong influence on customer purchasing behavior. While higher transaction volumes boost total revenue, the store must assess whether customers delay purchases for discounts and how margins are affected. Strategic discounting can expand market reach while maintaining profitability.

### 4. Location-Based Sales Analysis
Customers prefer purchasing "Computer and Electric Accessories" and "Electric Household Essentials" online due to the need for research, price comparison, and delivery convenience. The store should enhance digital promotions and optimize online sales channels for these categories.

## üèÜ Conclusion
The analysis reveals key trends in retail store sales. Transactions peak at the end of the year, driven by holiday shopping and promotional campaigns. High-demand products like beverages, furniture, and food contribute significantly to revenue, while premium-priced items like butcher products have lower sales volume but high revenue impact. Discounts effectively boost transaction volume, though further analysis is needed to assess profitability. Additionally, online sales are dominant for electronics-related products, highlighting the need for targeted digital marketing strategies. By leveraging these insights, the store can optimize inventory, pricing, and promotional strategies to maximize revenue and customer engagement.
